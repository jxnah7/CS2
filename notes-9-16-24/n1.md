*** Stack and reference ***

imagine variables being books and theyre stacked on top of each other
you can only grab the top one before trying to get to the bottom

lets imagine an array is in the middle with a size of 10, you cant edit it later if you use a stack

a computer has a big amount of memory, imagine a stack being 2 mb itll take up from the
large amount of memory bank or 'heap'


imagine needing 100k sprites that take up half your heap but then once you pass the lvl
youre able to free up that space

*** pointers ***

in memory address 18 you will find x, pointer y is storing x's address
when using y it will redirect you to x

a pointer is going to store an object's address
so everytime you use a pointer it will redirect you to the stored address

all a pointer does is store an address, thats all it can do
