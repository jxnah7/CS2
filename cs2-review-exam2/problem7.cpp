// RECURSION

/*
Describe what a base case and a general case is â€“ use our quiz retake as practice for this
to get a stronger sense of how to do this! I will not ask for implementations on this exam
(that will be on exam 3).
*/

/*

base calls stops the recursion from continuing, its the simplest instance or easiest thing we can do before telling recursion to go do everything else
general case is what uses recursion to calll itself (call the function of itself), and progressively reduces the problem size
