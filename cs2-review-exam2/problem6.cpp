// STACKS

/*

Assume you are given a setup for a stack (with a dynamic array). Be prepared to be able
to either explain (in plain language) and/or implement the following:
a. Push new items into the stack
b. “pop” or remove items from the stack
c. Resize the stack if needed

*/

/*
ANSWER:
  in plain english:
a) Pushing a new item onto a stack is adding another item ontop, similar to a stack of pancakes you can only add from top
b) popping from the stack is taking from the top or most recent item, again like pancakes you can only remove from the top
c) if the stack is full, we need to resize the amount of pancakes we can add, so we get a bigger plate, or if we have too little then we get a smaller plate
