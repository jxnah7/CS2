// when running code on vscode you use the following command


g++ -o output main.cpp      ****


// "output" is the placeholder name for the file that will be created
// "main.cpp" is the name of the program you want to run


// then once the file is executed you can use 


./output                    ****


// "output" is the same name you entered previously, it just executes the actual file
// and you will have an environment just like onlinegdb
