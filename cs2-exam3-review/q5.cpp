// what is the difference between a linked lsit and a 
// tree based data structure? How are they similar?

/*
They are structured differently. One is super linear while the other has
branches that can grow wide length and width wise

they both use nodes and pointers

you can traverse them both although a bit differently

linkedlist cannot have children
