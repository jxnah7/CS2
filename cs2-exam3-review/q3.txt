bubble sort is the fun one
it swaps the first two then compares if its larger
if it is then swap
if it isnt then move to next one
this is great to get the largst number to the back 
ensuring atleast 1 element is correctly placed

List: [5, 3, 8, 4]

    Compare 5 and 3: Swap → [3, 5, 8, 4]
    Compare 5 and 8: No Swap → [3, 5, 8, 4]
    Compare 8 and 4: Swap → [3, 5, 4, 8]

At the end of 1 iteration, the largest value (8) 
is in its correct position.




selection sort is pretty picky
so they only wanna select the smallest (or largest)
number in  a list , then carefull place it at the beginning
this ensures the very beginning is correctly placed

List: [5, 3, 8, 4]

    Find the minimum in [5, 3, 8, 4]: Minimum is 3.
    Swap 3 with the first element: [3, 5, 8, 4].

At the end of 1 iteration, the smallest value (3) 
is placed in its correct position.
