TASKL Build a tree from a list of values

list(9) = {0, 114, 16, 2, -6, 1, 10, 4, 5}

1. Start at the "root" node of the tree
2. Check if the current node is null (is there anything there)
  --YES: Put the number here (DONE)
  --NO: (there is a node here already)
  3. Check if the value we want to insert is greater than or less than
     current value
  --GREATER: move my current location to the right, and go back to step 2
  --LESS: move my location to the left, and go back to step 2
  --EQUAL: throw it away (DONE.)

Practice: Insert all nodes of "list" in order that they are listed
